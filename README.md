Hi, Iâ€™m Zaara ðŸ‘‹

I studied computer science & engineering at Lehigh University, where I built everything from blockchain infrastructure and VR games to smart farming platforms and parallel algorithms. Along the way, I fell in love with product development, scrappy prototyping, and clean, human-centered software.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring ways to apply AI agents and APIs to solve real-world problems. I have been particularly interested in developing an MCP server. I also enjoy building playful side projects. I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate on meaningful ideas, especially at the intersection of startups and systems thinking.

Outside of tech, Iâ€™m a fan of pixel art, singing a capella, playing board games with friends, and baking.
